## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

We also used an agile metodology in order to make our work flow better and more organized

## Optimizations
There are some features that we could add if we work on them longer, but the main features that we wanted are there.

## Lessons Learned:

We learned a lot about working in teams, making group projects, and we always learn new tricks and tips to make our code more readable and effective
